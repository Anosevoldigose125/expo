To submit your app to the app stores, you'll need to create a production build. This build is optimized for performance and size, and it includes all the necessary assets and configurations for the app stores.

## Prerequisites

Paid developer accounts are required to submit builds to the app stores. You will need the following:

- A [Google Play Developer](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/) membership ($25 one-time fee)
- An [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs) membership ($99 per year)

<Collapsible summary="Optional: Configure over-the-air updates">
Over-the-air updates allow you to send critical bug fixes and improvements to your users. To set it up, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas update:configure']} />
</Collapsible>

## Create a production build with EAS

To create a production build, run the following [EAS CLI](/develop/tools/#eas-cli) command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ eas build --profile production']} />

## Create a production build locally

To create a production build locally with Android Studio and Xcode, see the following guides.

These guides assume your project has **android** and/or **ios** directories containing native projects. If you use [Continuous Native Generation](/workflow/continuous-native-generation) then you will need to run [prebuild](/workflow/prebuild) to generate the directories.

> **Note**: When following the guides below, in step four, when you build the release **.aab** for Android, run `./gradlew app:bundleRelease` from the **android** directory instead of `npx react-native build-android --mode=release`.
